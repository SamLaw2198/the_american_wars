The Aftermath
=============

Over the course of many years, the Colonists won the war against the British.
Battles raged throughout the northern and southern colonies for several years,
but the battle in the colonies ceased when Washington led an attack and fought
in the Battle of Yorktown, Virginia. The British surrendered after their
soldiers lost.

The war officially came to a conclusion in 1783. A peace treaty was signed
in Paris, France, and King George III oficially recognized the Colonies as their
own independent nation, now known as the United States of America.
