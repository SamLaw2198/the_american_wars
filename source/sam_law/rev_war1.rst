The Stamp Act and The Boston Tea Party
======================================

The Stamp Act and Taxation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There were many factors that were attributed to the start of the Revolutionary 
War in 1775, but one of them was the Stamp Act. Britain had just won the 
Seven Years' War against France and Spain, but this led to a major financhial 
crisis for the British. Their national debt skyrocketed, and the cost 
of government establishment quintupled. 

In an attempt to offset their massive amount of debt, Britain passed the Stamp
Act in 1765. This act placed a direct tax on the American Colonies, taxing not
only stamps, but other printed materials like newspapers, legal documents and
even playing cards. The Colonists believed that the tax was unfair, as they were
being taxed by a country that which they didn't have their own elected
representatives.

The Stamp Act was eventually repealed quickly in 1776, but it set a precedent
from the British to the Colonists, with the British claiming that they had the
right to pass laws that were detrimental to the Colonies if it meant they could
improve life in Britain. From 1767 onward, the British passed laws that raised
salaries for civil servants, but this increased opposition of the British among
the Colonists.


The Boston Tea Party
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When British soldiers occupied Boston in 1770, resentment between the Colonists
and British increased significantly when they opened fire on civilians in an act
now known as the Boston Massacre. The backlash was enough for Parliament to
repeal almost all taxes on the Colonists in an attempt to save face.

The British passed the Tea Act in 1773, which taxed the Colonists on tea. The
actions that followed this act were met with fierce opposition from the 
Colonists. On December 16, 1773, a Colonial resistance group boarded many
British ships in Boston Harbor and threw their entire supply of tea into the
water.

In response, Parliament passed legislation, referred to as the "Intolerable
Acts", that were meant to undermine the local democracy in the Colonies. The
Colonists believed that these laws undermined their natural rights and their
rights as Englishmen, which increased support of the American Patriots, 
Colonists that rebelled against the British and wanted Independence.
