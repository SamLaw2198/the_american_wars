D-Day Storming the Beaches of Normandy
======================================

During World War II, the Battle of Normandy, or D-Day, resulted in 
the liberation of Western Europe. This battle happened when over 
156,000 allied forces landed on the fortified coast of Normandy, 
France. This was one of largest military invasions in history and 
required extensive planning. Prior to this battle, the allied forces 
conducted a large scale mission to deceive the Germans and mislead 
them about what the target was. This battle led to all of Northern 
France being liberated and was considered "the beginning of the end 
of the war" in Europe. France general Dwight D. Eisenhower called 
the operation a crusade in which, "we will accept nothing less than
 full victory." During this battle more than 5000 ships and 13,000 
 aircraft supported the soldiers on the ground during the invasion. 
 More than 9,000 allied soldiers were killed or wounded, but his led 
 to more than 100,000 soldiers to begin recontrolling Europe and 
 defeating Hitlerâ€™s troops. 

Significance of the D-Day Invasion
----------------------------------

Without D-Day, Hitler would have deployed many more divisions to resist 
the allied army. He would have had much more time to develop his "weapon of 
terror", the V2. This could have led to the war lasting much longer of even
a victory for the Axis forces.
