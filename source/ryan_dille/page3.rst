Casualties in World War II
==========================

World War II was the deadliest military conflict in history in terms of 
casualties and countries involved. The exact amount of human lives lost during 
the war is unknown. Historians have said the total amount of casualties may have 
totaled over 60 million. This does not just include military service personnel, 
this also includes civilians from cross fire, bombings, or even executions. At 
the time of this war, the world population was estimated to be about 2.3 billion 
people. This means that nearly 3% of the world’s population was killed in this
war. Other experts say that the death toll could be closer to 80 million, over 
half of these killed being civilians.
