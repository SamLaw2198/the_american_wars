Ironclads of the Civil War
==========================

President Lincoln gave the first objective of his navy to blockade the entire southern coast. This would cut off the Confederates from the rest of the world. At the beginning of the war the Union had 40 navy ships to complete this task. President Lincoln also gave the order to construct more warships to help accomplish this task, but constructing more ships took time. 


Compared to the Confederates the Union navy was massive. At the start of the war the confederates did not have a navy. They had a few merchant ships and some shipyard but no warships. The confederates stuck to attacking the Northern merchant ships at sea.


The confederates navy luck turned after they captured a northern naval base in Virginia. The Merrimack was one of the ships at port when the Confederates took control. In order to outgun the Northern navy they converted the Merrimack into an ironclad ship and renamed it Virginia. An ironclad ship is a ship with iron on the outside of the hull to prevent damage from cannon fire.

	
Shortly after the North needed to combat the Virginia. Inventor John Ericsson invented the Monitor. The Monitor was an ironclad ship with the worldâ€™s first rotating gun turret and with most of the ship underwater. When the Monitor fought the Virginia the battle resulted in a tie. But the Northern navy still had to be wary of the Virginia stalking the waters around the southern coast.
