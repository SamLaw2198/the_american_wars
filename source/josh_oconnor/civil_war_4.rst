Sherman's March to the Sea
==========================

Atlanta was a major transit point an industrial city for the Southern forces. 
After General William Sherman captured Atlanta he had to stop the southern 
forces from attacking the Union supply lines. General Sherman decided to split 
his army in half. Half was going to attack the Confederate army, while the other
half was going with General Sherman.


Sherman’s March to the Sea was tactic used by General Sherman to harass the 
south until they surrendered. The main problem with this tactic it focused on 
attacking the Southern civilians. This tactic is known as total war. The Union 
Army attacked farms, stole food and livestock and burned the houses of civilians
that resisted.

	
The march went from the Atlanta all the way to the coast consisting of 285 
miles. The confederate attempt to counter the attack failed. It only killed 62
union soldiers and 650 confederates. After the attack, the confederate troops 
fled from General Sherman trying to destroy bridges, and provisions before the
Union troops could reach them. Sherman’s March lasted until the end of the
war.
