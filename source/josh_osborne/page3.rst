Chemical Warfare
================

Chemical Warfare is just another reason that the Vietnam War sticks out. The
main chemical that was used is known as Agent Orange. Agent Orange is a 
powerful herbicide that was used by U.S. military forced to eliminate forest 
cover and crops so that the troops would run out of important resources to
survive. 

Operation Ranch Hand was a U.S. program and was responsible for spraying more
than 20 million gallons of various herbicides over Vietnam. Agent Orange 
contained a deadly chemical, dioxin, which was the most commonly used herbicide.
 
 It was later proven to cause serious health issues including cancer, birth
defects, rashes, and severe psychological and neurological problems. These
problems primarily happened among the Vietnamese people, but there were
returning American servicemen who ran into problems with their family.

The consequences of being exposed to Agent Orange were unfortunate, but a huge 
deal was not made about it. That is until the media captured some photos of the
herbicide in action as well as some results that were left on innocent women
and children from Vietnamese villages that were dumped on.
