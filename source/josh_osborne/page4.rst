U.S. Public Reaction
====================

As you know, the Vietnam War was the first war to actually be covered by the
 media, which everyone thought would be pretty cool. Until the citizens of the
  United States saw pictures and videos of what truly went on at war. 

Complete brutality from both sides of fighting, gore that had never been seen by
 the United States public before. Protests began to arise, but it was not until
  the North Vietnamese launched the Tet Offensive, some 70,000 Vietnamese troops
   sent to make fierce attacks on over 100 cities and towns in South Vietnam.

The reports of the Tet Offensive stunned the U.S. public, especially when they
 heard that 200,000 troops were requested to be sent over for help. There was
  discontent all across the nation, protests and riots taking place in big
   cities everywhere. 

The public was already very unhappy with how the war was being handled by U.S. 
officials, when in 1970, a joint operation took place where U.S and South 
\Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia to wipe out North Vietnamâ€™s supply bases 
there. While this went on, South Vietnamese also invaded Laos.

The invasion of these countries was in violation of international law, and
 sparked a new raging wave of protests on college campuses across America. One 
 protest that took place on May 4, 1970 at Kent State University in Ohio, some
  National Guardsmen shot and killed four students. And then ten days later 
  Jackson State University had a protest where two students were killed by 
  police.
